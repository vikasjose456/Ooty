        <p>The Nilgiri Mountain Railway is a narrow-gauge train from Mettupalayam to Ooty in southern India. As soon as the toy train pulls out of the station, passengers are transfixed by the spectacular mountain scenery surrounding them. The train track winds through rolling green hills, plunges into remote valleys, and passes by verdant farmland and forests, offering views that are breathtaking in their beauty. </p>

      <p>It is a point on the way to Dolphin's Nose, and the Seat was so called by the then Collector Mr. E.B. Thomas, after one Captain Lamb who made earnest attempts to open a path to the place. It is situated in Burliar village and is about 8 kilometre from Coonoor. It was discovered by a British army officer Lamb, hence the name Lamb's Rock</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Dolphin Nose Coonoor</h2>
      <p>The place gets its name because of the protruding flat rock that resembles the nose of a dolphin. It is from this point that you can get the best view of the valleys beneath. A visit to this view point is surely promising as the view itself is not the only offering it gives.</p>
